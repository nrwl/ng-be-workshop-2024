# `📖 Exercise:` Exploring flaky task detection on Nx Agents

## 📚&nbsp;&nbsp;**Learning outcomes**

- Create a flaky task
- Learn how Nx Agents automatically detect them and

## 🏋️‍♀️&nbsp;&nbsp;Steps:

### 1. Create a flaky task

Flaky tasks don't have to be tests necessarily, however that's the most common scenario.

> ℹ️ How does it work? Check the [docs](https://nx.dev/ci/features/flaky-tasks) for more details how Nx Agents detect and automatically retry flaky tasks.

Feel free to use your imagination for creating a flaky test.

Commit the change and push it to trigger a new CI run.

### 2. Cause a couple of CI runs to see the flaky task detection in action

Make a couple of arbitrary changes and push them to trigger to a new CI run.

> Feel free to adjust the CI setup to restrict it to just the flaky targets to speed things up.

If you succeed you should see a note at the top of the dashboard indicating the presence of some flaky tasks.

Also if you open the the project containing the flaky task you should see how it got retried:
