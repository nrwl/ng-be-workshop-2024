# `üìñ Exercise:` Task distribution with Nx Agents

## üìö&nbsp;&nbsp;**Learning outcomes**

- How to adjust your CI to enable task distribution with Nx Agents
- How to create a custom launch template for Nx Agents

## üèãÔ∏è‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è&nbsp;&nbsp;Steps:

### 1. Update your CI config to enable Nx Agents

Nx Agents allow you to distribute tasks across multiple machines with the main advantage that their configuraton is declarative and therefore adjusts to changes to your workspace.

To enable Nx Agents, let's adjust the CI config. There should be already a commented line for it. Uncomment it and also make sure agents stop after `e2e` tasks.

> Note, check the [Nx Agents docs](https://nx.dev/ci/features/distribute-task-execution) for any help on the syntax.

<details>
<summary>üê≥&nbsp;&nbsp;Hint: uncomment agents</summary>

```bash
- run: npx nx-cloud start-ci-run --distribute-on="3 linux-medium-js" --stop-agents-after="e2e"
```

</details>
 
Also, for now, uncomment the `deploy` target. We'll come back to it later in this lab.

Now commit the changes and push them to trigger a new CI run.

Inspect the Nx Cloud dashboard to see the Agents instantiate and process tasks

### 2. Dynamically scale Nx Agents based on the size of the changeset

By default our CI setup uses a static number of Nx Agents. You can fine-tune this as you need more agents or less. You can check the "Analysis" tab in the Nx Cloud dashboard:

![agents analysis](images/nx-agents-analysis.png)

However, PRs can vary in size, where sometimes only 2 projects might be affected, while other times it might be 10. This would result in a lot of idle agents when many are underutilized.

To fix this we can create configuration to dynamically scale the number of agents based on the size of the changeset.

**Create a new file** `.nx/workflows/dynamic-changesets.yaml`. [Check the docs](https://nx.dev/ci/features/dynamic-agents) for help on the format.

Next, adjust your Nx Agent setup in your CI config to use the new launch template and test it out by triggering new CI runs with different changeset sizes.

<details>
<summary>üê≥&nbsp;&nbsp;Solution (changesets)</summary>

```yaml
distribute-on:
  small-changeset: 2 linux-medium-js
  medium-changeset: 5 linux-medium-js
  large-changeset: 8 linux-medium-js
```

</details>

### 3. Create a custom template to install Fly.io

Re-enable the `deploy` target in your CI config and check the output log. You should probably see an error about not being able to find `fly` in the PATH.

```bash
/bin/sh: 1: flyctl: not found
```

This is because the [default Nx Agents templates](https://github.com/nrwl/nx-cloud-workflows/tree/main/launch-templates) do not include the `fly` CLI.

To use the Fly CLI on Nx Agents we need to create a custom launch template. Use the [docs](https://nx.dev/ci/reference/launch-templates) as a reference to create a new template in `.nx/workflows/agents.yaml`.

<details>
<summary>üê≥&nbsp;&nbsp;Hint: Installing Fly.io</summary>

```
curl -L https://fly.io/install.sh | sh
```

To add it to the PATH, you can use the following command:

```
echo PATH="$HOME/.fly/bin:$PATH" >> $NX_CLOUD_ENV
```

</details>

<details>
<summary>üê≥&nbsp;&nbsp;Solution (custom launch template)</summary>

```yaml
launch-templates:
  ngbe-linux-medium-js:
    resource-class: 'docker_linux_amd64/medium'
    image: 'ubuntu22.04-node20.11-v10'
    init-steps:
      - name: Checkout
        uses: 'nrwl/nx-cloud-workflows/v4/workflow-steps/checkout/main.yaml'
      - name: Restore Node Modules Cache
        uses: 'nrwl/nx-cloud-workflows/v4/workflow-steps/cache/main.yaml'
        inputs:
          key: 'package-lock.json|yarn.lock|pnpm-lock.yaml'
          paths: 'node_modules'
          base-branch: 'main'
      - name: Restore Browser Binary Cache
        uses: 'nrwl/nx-cloud-workflows/v4/workflow-steps/cache/main.yaml'
        inputs:
          key: 'package-lock.json|yarn.lock|pnpm-lock.yaml|"browsers"'
          paths: |
            '../.cache/Cypress'
          base-branch: 'main'
      - name: Install Node Modules
        uses: 'nrwl/nx-cloud-workflows/v4/workflow-steps/install-node-modules/main.yaml'
      - name: Install Browsers (if needed)
        uses: 'nrwl/nx-cloud-workflows/v4/workflow-steps/install-browsers/main.yaml'
      - name: Install Fly.io
        script: |
          curl -L https://fly.io/install.sh | sh
          echo PATH="$HOME/.fly/bin:$PATH" >> $NX_CLOUD_ENV
```

Use the new launch template in your CI config, then commit and push the changes to trigger a new CI run.

<details>
<summary>üê≥&nbsp;&nbsp;Hint</summary>

If you're using dynamic scaling, you'll need to update the Nx agent image that's being used in the `dynamic-changesets.yaml` file.

</details>

Inspect the Nx Cloud dashboard. You should see your new launch template being used.

> ‚ö†Ô∏è&nbsp;&nbsp;Your Fly.io deployment might still not work. Check the logs on Nx CLoud to see why.

Use the following [docs page](https://nx.dev/ci/reference/launch-templates#pass-environment-variables-to-agents) to fix the issue.

<details>
<summary>üê≥&nbsp;&nbsp;Solution</summary>

You need to forward the environment variables to the Nx Agents by using the `--with-env-vars` flag:

```bash
 --with-env-vars="SURGE_DOMAIN_STORE,SURGE_TOKEN,FLY_API_TOKEN"
```
